# CHD-shiny-app
An R Shiny dashboard for interactive exploration of supplementary tables associated with the publication "Computational analysis of congenital heart disease associated SNPs: unveiling their impact on the gene regulatory system" (Vashisht et al., BMC Genomics, 2025). Vashisht et.al. presented a computational method to identify non-coding CHD-SNPs characterizing as cardiac enhancers and then exploring their functional implications (conservation, TFBS, eQTLs) alongside analyzing coding CHD-SNPs.

The Shiny app should allow researchers to follow similar exploratory paths, allowing filtering and linking of CHD-SNPs, enhancer and regulatory data.
